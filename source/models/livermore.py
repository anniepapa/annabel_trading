        """stop limit buy:  # noqa
            In a stop-limit buy order, the stop price should be set below the limit price.
            In addition, on degiro, seems stop price has to higher than the last price. Example:

            - last price: $24,70
            - stop price (minimal valid value): $24.71
            - limit sell (minimal valid value): $24.72

            This ensures that the order is triggered when the stock price falls to or below
                the stop price, and the subsequent limit order is executed at the specified
                limit price or better.

            Here's the corrected example for a stop-limit buy order:

            Current market price: $50
            Stop price: $45
            Limit price: $46

            In this example, you want to buy a security if its price drops to or below $45.
                Once the stop price is reached or breached, the order is triggered and becomes a limit order.
                The limit price of $46 specifies the maximum price you are willing to pay for the security.

            Setting the stop price below the limit price ensures that the order is triggered before the
                limit price is reached. If the stop price is equal to or higher than the limit price,
                the order may be immediately executed as a market order when the stop condition is met,
                potentially resulting in a purchase at a price higher than intended.

            stop limit buy:
            - last price: $274,32
            - stop price (minimal valid value, equal or lower is allowed): $274,32 / 33
            - limit buy (minimal valid value, must lower than stop price): $274,31 / 32
